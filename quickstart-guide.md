# Quickstart Guide

Welcome to the StoryScript Quickstart guide. This guide is recommended for People who already familiar with Programming in Python or Other similar programming languages.

### Install Guide

To install StoryScript, First download a Source code from the Main branch.
Then, Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395/)
To ensure that everything works, You may need to download Python 3.9.5

### Arithmetics

These are all Arithmetics in StoryScript:

| Name | Sign |
| :--- | :--- |
| Add | + |
| Subtract | - |
| Multiply | \* |
| Divide | / |
| Modulo | % |
| Power | \*\* |

### Variables

Unlike Python, Variables are Strictly typed. For example:

```csharp
// Declare an Integer
int a = 10

// This will throws error
a = 3.14
```

These are all types currently available in StoryScript:

| Full Name | Alias used in the Language |
| :--- | :--- |
| Integer | int |
| Floating point number | float |
| Boolean value \(true/false\) | bool |
| List\* | list |
| Dictionary\* | dictionary |
| Tuple\* | tuple |
| Dynamic | dynamic |
| String | string |

\*This type is planned, But not implemented yet

#### Setting symbol

To set a new value to a variable, You will need an equal \(=\) symbol for that. But there's more! Explore what are those here:

| Name | Symbol |
| :--- | :--- |
| Set | = |
| Multiply and set | \*= |
| Add and set | += |
| Subtract and set | -= |
| Divide and set | /= |
| Modulo-ing and set | %= |

#### Variables naming rules

You can't declare a variable with a name with these violations:

1. Using StoryScript keyword
2. Starts with Digits
3. Using Type keyword
4. Function/Variable/Namespace name

StoryScript & Types keywords are:

```csharp
if, else, var, int, bool, float,
list, dictionary, tuple, const, override,
func, end, input, throw, string, typeof,
del, namespace, and, or, then, and "?"
```

And there might be more in the future, And There maybe a Custom type in The future.

### Loops

Currently, In StoryScript, There is only 1 loop. Which is **loopfor loop**. The loopfor loop in StoryScript is a Loop that loops for a specific number of times.  
For example:

```lua
loopfor 10
    print ("ping pong")
end
```

This piece of code, Will print "ping pong" 10 times.

### If statement

the If statement in StoryScript, Is in this format:

```lua
if condition then
    statements
end
```

#### Conditions

Currently, In StoryScript, There are 6 Comparison symbol

| Name | Symbol |
| :--- | :--- |
| More than | &gt; |
| Less than | &lt; |
| Equal to | == |
| Not equal to | != |
| More than or Equal to | &gt;= |
| Less than or Equal to | &lt;= |

```lua
var a = 10
if a >= 5 then
    print ("a is more than or equal to 5")
end
```

To include multiple Statements, You'll need to add && sign. For example:

```lua
if a >= 5 then a = 10 && print ("a is more than or equal to 5 and its value is now changed to 10.")end
```

#### Multiple Conditions

To use Multiple conditions in StoryScript, There are 2 keywords for you to use.

"and" and "or"

The keyword is pretty self explanatory. "and" will check if the both condition is true.

And "or" will check if either one condition is true.

For example:

```lua
string userinput = input ()
if userinput == "I hate you" or input == "I don't like you" then
    print (";-;")
end
```

This code will check if the variable userinput is equal to "I hate ypu" __or__ "I don't like you"
If the condition was true, Print out ";-;"

#### Else case

Else case is used to run code when the Condition im the If statement is not true.

For example:

```lua
float a = 3.14
if a == 4.13 then
    print ("a is Equal to 4.13")
else
    print ("a is not Equal to 4.13")
end
```

In this code, There is a Variable called "a" which is Set to 3.14.

If a is equal to 4.13, Then print "a is Equal to 4.13".
Else, print "a is not equal to 4.13"
